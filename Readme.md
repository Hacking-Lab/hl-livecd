## OpenVPN HL 2.0
If you need a reverse-shell from one of the vulnerable services back to your local computer, you must connect to our vulnerable systems using [OpenVPN](https://github.com/Hacking-Lab/hl2-openvpn-ost.ch). The vulnerable services are firewalled and therefore you cannot connect back to an internet ip address.
